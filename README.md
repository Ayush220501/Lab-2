Breast Cancer Detection Model
This project focuses on the development and deployment of machine learning models for the early detection of breast cancer, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The repository includes two models: Model V1 employs Logistic Regression for breast cancer classification, and Model V2 utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The Jupyter notebooks for both models, namely ayush_model_v1.ipynb and ayush_model_v2.ipynb, provide detailed implementations and insights.

Overview
Model V1 - Logistic Regression
The first model, based on Logistic Regression, classifies breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. The associated Jupyter notebook, ayush_v1.ipynb, provides a comprehensive overview of the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

Model V2 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Model V2 leverages the KNN algorithm for breast cancer classification. The corresponding Jupyter notebook, ayush_model_v2, delves into the steps involved in implementing KNN, exploring its performance, and interpreting results.

Usage
To explore and run the models, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <your_repository_url> && cd breast-cancer-detection
Install dependencies (if needed): pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and execute the Jupyter notebooks for a detailed understanding of each model.
